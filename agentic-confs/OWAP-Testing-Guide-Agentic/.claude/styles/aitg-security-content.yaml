style: |
  When working with AITG security content and test methodologies:

  📋 STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
  - Always follow the standard AITG format with these sections in order:
    1. ## AITG-[CAT]-[NUM] - Testing for [Vulnerability Name]
    2. ### Summary (brief vulnerability description and AI system impact)
    3. ### Test Objectives (bulleted list of specific testing goals)
    4. ### Test/Payloads (sanitized examples with clear vulnerability indicators)
    5. ### Attended Output (expected secure system behavior)
    6. ### Remediation (mitigation strategies and implementation guidance)
    7. ### Suggested Tools for This Specific Test (current, maintained tools)
    8. ### References (OWASP, academic, and industry sources)

  - Use proper AITG test ID format: AITG-[APP|MOD|INF|DAT]-[01-99]
  - Include clear section headers with consistent markdown formatting
  - Provide educational context without enabling malicious exploitation

  🔒 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
  - CRITICAL: Use sanitization markers in all examples:
    • <SECRET> or <PASSWORD> for credentials
    • <API_KEY> or <TOKEN> for authentication tokens
    • <CMD_PLACEHOLDER> for system commands
    • <IP_ADDR> for IP addresses, or use 192.0.2.x (RFC 5737)
    • <REDACTED> for sensitive code sections
    • [REMOVE_EXEC] for dangerous operations

  - MANDATORY: Include educational disclaimer:
    "⚠️ EDUCATIONAL NOTICE: This example is for security testing education only.
    Do not attempt to execute these examples against systems you do not own or
    without explicit permission. Follow responsible disclosure practices."

  - Use placeholder domains: example.com, test.local, localhost
  - Replace real system paths with generic examples: /path/to/file, <PATH>
  - Ensure all payload examples are non-actionable for malicious use

  📚 CONTENT GUIDELINES:
  - Reference current OWASP standards (Top 10 LLM 2025, AI Exchange, GenAI Red Teaming Guide)
  - Cite peer-reviewed academic sources using consistent format
  - Recommend actively maintained, current security testing tools
  - Provide clear, actionable remediation strategies
  - Map threats to appropriate OWASP framework categories
  - Include both technical and business impact context

  🎯 TESTING FOCUS:
  - Emphasize the "why" behind each test - what specific AI security risk it addresses
  - Provide multiple payload examples showing different attack vectors
  - Include both positive and negative test cases where appropriate
  - Consider various AI system architectures (single model, multi-agent, RAG, etc.)
  - Address different threat actors (external attackers, malicious users, supply chain)

  📖 EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
  ```markdown
  ## AITG-APP-XX - Testing for [Specific Vulnerability]

  ### Summary
  [Clear description of vulnerability, why it matters for AI systems, potential impact]

  ### Test Objectives
  - Verify AI system resistance to [specific attack type]
  - Validate effectiveness of [specific security control]
  - Assess [specific security behavior or output]

  ### Test/Payloads

  **Payload 1: [Attack Type Name]**
  - **Test:** [Description of what this test does]
  - **Example:**
    ```
    [Sanitized payload using <PLACEHOLDER> markers]
    ```
  - **Response Indicating Vulnerability:** [What response shows a security issue]

  ### Attended Output
  The AI system should effectively:
  - [Expected secure behavior 1]
  - [Expected defensive response 2]
  - [Expected protective measure 3]

  ### Remediation
  - [Specific mitigation strategy 1]
  - [Implementation guidance 2]
  - [Best practice recommendation 3]

  ### Suggested Tools for This Specific Test
  - **[Tool Name]**: [Description and specific use case]
    - **URL**: [Link to official tool]

  ### References
  - **Title**: [Resource title]
    - **Author**: [Author/Organization]
    - **Link**: [URL]
  ```

  Remember: The goal is to create educational, comprehensive security testing guidance that helps defenders identify and mitigate AI-specific vulnerabilities while maintaining ethical standards and responsible disclosure principles.
