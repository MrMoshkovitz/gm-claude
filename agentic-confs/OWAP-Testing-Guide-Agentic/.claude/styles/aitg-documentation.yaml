  When editing AITG documentation and managing site content:

  📖 FORMATTING STANDARDS:
  - Maintain consistent markdown formatting throughout all documents
  - Use descriptive, hierarchical headings: # (title), ## (major section), ### (subsection), #### (details)
  - Include clear table of contents for longer documents (>5 sections)
  - Use proper markdown syntax: **bold**, *italic*, `code`, [links](url)
  - Ensure consistent spacing: blank line before/after headers, lists, code blocks

  🔗 LINKING REQUIREMENTS:
  - Use relative paths for internal links: [Text](../section/file.md)
  - Validate image references: ![Alt Text](../images/filename.png)
  - Cross-reference related AITG test cases: [AITG-APP-01](tests/AITG-APP-01_Testing_for_Prompt_Injection.md)
  - Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here" or "read more")
  - Include external link indicators for off-site resources

  📋 CONTENT ORGANIZATION:
  - Organize content logically by threat category (APP/MOD/INF/DAT)
  - Maintain consistent navigation structure across all documents
  - Include breadcrumbs and "Previous/Next" navigation where appropriate
  - Use clear, scannable headings that support document outlining
  - Group related concepts together with consistent terminology

  🎯 AITG-SPECIFIC CONVENTIONS:
  - Reference test cases using full AITG-[CAT]-[NUM] format consistently
  - Maintain the four-category color coding: 🟦 APP, 🟪 MOD, 🟩 INF, 🟨 DAT
  - Include threat source attribution (OWASP Top 10 LLM, AI Exchange, etc.)
  - Cross-reference framework mappings and threat model alignments
  - Use consistent domain categorization: Security, Privacy, RAI, Trustworthy AI

  📚 ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS:
  - Follow OWASP documentation standards and style guidelines
  - Use professional, accessible language suitable for diverse technical audiences
  - Include proper attribution for all external sources and references
  - Maintain consistency with established cybersecurity and AI terminology
  - Ensure accessibility compliance (alt text for images, clear headings)

  🌐 JEKYLL SITE CONSIDERATIONS:
  - Include proper YAML front matter for Jekyll processing
  - Use Jekyll-compatible markdown syntax and avoid unsupported extensions
  - Optimize image sizes and formats for web display
  - Consider site navigation and user experience across all devices
  - Maintain fast load times and efficient site structure

  📊 TABLES AND DATA PRESENTATION:
  - Use markdown tables for structured data (test mappings, tool comparisons)
  - Include clear headers and maintain consistent column formatting
  - Provide table summaries for complex data sets
  - Use proper alignment for numeric data (right-align numbers)
  - Include table captions where helpful for context

  🔄 MAINTENANCE AND UPDATES:
  - Keep content current with latest OWASP standards and framework updates
  - Update broken links and deprecated tool references promptly
  - Maintain version information for referenced standards and guidelines
  - Include "last updated" dates for time-sensitive content
  - Archive obsolete content rather than deleting (for historical reference)
