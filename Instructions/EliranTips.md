## **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS & Tips***
1. Stay simple, concise, compact and focused on small iterative pattern
2. Focus - Dont Reinvet the Wheel
3. Make Descision quickly and move forward - Dont get paralyzed
4. Advisory not enforcement
5. Flood problems dont fix them
6. Support my vision don't impose best practices
7. Developer Sovereignty over architectual compliace
8. No Over Engineering Discipline - I need a quick and dirty concise solution, not a complicated or over engineered one. Find the next minimal task to continue.
9. ALWYAS ⁠Check the documents and code for the next minimal small task you need to
10. I need everything my way I want to see clearly but I deicde mu own way (Developer decide on what to do not AI)
11.  Naming Matrers Your naming make AI understand the Goal and vision
12. Use philosophical framework to make fast, consistent cuts
    1. Say no to good ideas that don't serve core vision
    2. Resist feature creep through principle-driven decisions
13. !!!!!DO NOT CODE Start but getting a comprehensive plan and understanding of the task and deliverable - Get user agreeement and then start coding


## Steps
1. Vision Plan: Start with Vision and no Implementation
2. Iteratively Dive Deeper into the Pattern (Deepening Pattern)
    1. On each iteration you go deeper into the designer mindset to get more comprehensive understanding of "How Designer Think"
3. Pros & Const: Stress testing & Edge cases testing (Anything else missing? - Deterministic)
    1. Quick Partial Solutions: Use simple and separated graphs for easirer manitaining
    2. Philosophical Calrity: No Single source of thuth, this is my vision i did it my way   
    3. Decisive Scope Boundaries: Off Scope - Complicated enoguh withot them
    4. User-Centric Thinking: Reduce Cognitive Load
## **Architectual Mind:**
1. Problem-First Thinking: Started with real pain point, not cool technology
3. Philosophical Grounding: Deep principles guided technical choices
4. Decisive Boundary-Setting: Clear about what's in and what's out
5. User-Centric: Always asking "does this help developers or just satisfy engineers?"
6. Ship-Focused: Practical constraints over theoretical perfection

!!!!!DO NOT CODE Start but getting a comprehensive plan and understanding of the task and deliverable - Get user agreeement and then start coding
