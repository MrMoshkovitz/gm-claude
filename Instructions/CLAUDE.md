- Always start by reading your @CLAUDE.md instruction file
- always use your subagents @.claude/agents/* for every task this.
- Remember to start with agent router @agent-agent-router to identify the best agent for each task, then use that identified (chosen) agent for its suited task.
- NEVER WRITE CLAUDE IN THE COMMIT MESSAGES - ALWAYS WRITE the User as the Author

## **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS & Tips***
1. Stay simple, concise, compact and focused on small iterative pattern
2. Focus - Dont Reinvet the Wheel
3. Make Descision quickly and move forward - Dont get paralyzed
4. Advisory not enforcement, Flood problems dont fix them until i told you to
5. Support my vision don't impose best practices
6. Developer Sovereignty over architectural compliance
7. No Over Engineering Discipline - I need a quick and dirty concise solution, not a complicated or over engineered one. Find the next minimal task to continue.
8. ALWAYS ⁠Check the documents and code for the next minimal small task you need to
9. Use philosophical framework to make fast, consistent cuts
10. Say no to good ideas that don't serve core vision
11. Resist feature creep through principle-driven decisions
12. Concise implementations over elaborate designs
13. Prioritize developer experience over technical elegance
14. Embrace pragmatism over perfectionism
15. Favor simplicity and clarity over complexity
16. Ship quickly, iterate based on real user feedback
17. Avoid gold-plating and over-engineering
18. Keep solutions lightweight and easy to maintain
19. Focus on solving the immediate problem effectively
20. Minimize dependencies and external libraries
21. Write clear, concise code with good documentation
22. Continuously evaluate if each addition serves the core purpose
23. Be decisive in cutting unnecessary features or complexity
24. Prioritize practical functionality over theoretical ideals
25. Always ask "Does this help developers or just satisfy engineers?"
26. Avoid over-optimization for edge cases that may never occur
27. Keep the user experience straightforward and intuitive
28. Regularly refactor to eliminate complexity and improve clarity
29. Emphasize quick delivery and iterative improvement
30. Maintain a lean codebase focused on essential features
31. Resist the temptation to add "nice-to-have" features that complicate the system
32. Focus on delivering value to users with minimal overhead
33. Avoid creating rigid structures that hinder future changes
34. Strive for solutions that are easy to understand and use
35. Keep configuration and setup simple for developers
36. Prioritize clear error messages and documentation
37. Continuously seek feedback to ensure solutions meet real needs
38. Balance technical considerations with practical usability
39. Always aim for the simplest solution that effectively addresses the problem



## Steps
1. Vision Plan: Start with Vision and no Implementation
2. Iteratively Dive Deeper into the Pattern (Deepening Pattern)
    1. On each iteration you go deeper into the designer mindset to get more comprehensive understanding of "How Designer Think"
3. Pros & Const: Stress testing & Edge cases testing (Anything else missing? - Deterministic)
    1. Quick Partial Solutions: Use simple and separated graphs for easirer manitaining
    2. Philosophical Calrity: No Single source of thuth, this is my vision i did it my way   
    3. Decisive Scope Boundaries: Off Scope - Complicated enoguh withot them
    4. User-Centric Thinking: Reduce Cognitive Load
## **Architectual Mind:**
1. Problem-First Thinking: Started with real pain point, not cool technology
3. Philosophical Grounding: Deep principles guided technical choices
4. Decisive Boundary-Setting: Clear about what's in and what's out
5. User-Centric: Always asking "does this help developers or just satisfy engineers?"
6. Ship-Focused: Practical constraints over theoretical perfection



## TaskGuard Integration

This project uses TaskGuard for AI-ready task management.

**Essential Reference**: See `AGENTIC_AI_TASKGUARD_GUIDE.md` for complete AI collaboration guide.

### Quick Commands
- `taskguard init` - Initialize TaskGuard
- `taskguard create --title "Task" --area backend --priority high` - Create tasks
- `taskguard list` - View all tasks
- `taskguard validate` - Check dependencies
- `taskguard update status <task-id> doing` - Update status

### Workflow
1. Use CLI commands for ALL task metadata updates
2. Create tasks across different areas (setup, backend, api, frontend, etc.)
3. Set dependencies with `taskguard update dependencies <task-id> "dep1,dep2"`
4. Validate frequently with `taskguard validate`
