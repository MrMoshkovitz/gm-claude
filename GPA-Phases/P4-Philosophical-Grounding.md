### Phase 4: Philosophical Grounding

**Objective**: Establish decision-making principles that filter subsequent choices and maintain architectural coherence.

**Process**:
- Identify core values and principles underlying the solution
- Connect technical choices to human-centered philosophy
- Establish clear boundaries and non-negotiables
- Create decision-making framework for future trade-offs
- **Critical**: Articulate philosophy clearly to provide consistent decision criteria

**Rationale**: This phase transforms scattered technical concerns into coherent worldview. Philosophical grounding prevents both human and AI from getting lost in infinite optimization cycles by providing consistent decision criteria.

**Example**: The "My Way" principle in our case study became a lens for every subsequent architectural decision.

**Prompt 5 (Phase 4: Philosophical Grounding):**
```
Version control and branches: we will use a graphs database, allow us to save for later sessions and collaborate teams. Plus efficient diffs. No need to reinvent the wheel. I think separate graphs will be easier to maintain/sync.
Team conflicts - our job is to flood problems, might suggest but not fix and replace the developer. Evolution problem: up to the developer to decide. Cognitive load: this system will reduce them.
Meta Challenge and Philosophy: no single point of truth(except one god), This is my vision, I did it my way...

Dynamic situation you described: off the scope of this project (vision<->codebase<->tracelog), It's complicated enough without them).
