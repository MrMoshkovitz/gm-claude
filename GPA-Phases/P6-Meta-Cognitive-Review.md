### Phase 6: Meta-Cognitive Review

**Objective**: Analyze and improve the design process itself.

**Process**:
- Examine decision patterns and methodology effectiveness
- Identify reusable principles and process improvements
- Document methodology evolution for future projects
- Build conscious competence in human-AI collaboration

**Rationale**: Continuous process improvement prevents methodology stagnation and builds systematic capability for future human-AI design collaboration.

**Prompt 8 (Phase 6: Meta-Cognitive Review):**
```
I want one last meta review document on how my (the user, Eliran) approach of designing to help my friends:
How I introduced you the problem, then we extended it, review it and I responded to your concerns, then to the vision, to the final plans. I might confused the order. Dig into my thinking process.
```
