### Phase 5: Principled Boundary Setting

**Objective**: Use philosophical framework to make rapid, consistent scope decisions.

**Process**:
- Apply established principles to each identified concern
- Make decisive cuts to features that don't serve core vision
- Resist feature creep through principle-driven decisions
- Maintain focus on essential functionality
- **Final Implementation**: Create all deliverable files at once in a single prompt, not sequentially

**Rationale**: Without principled boundary setting, AI collaboration leads to scope explosion. Every AI-suggested improvement seems reasonable in isolation, but collectively they destroy focus and delay shipping.

**Decision Framework**: 
- Does this serve the core vision?
- Does this align with established principles?
- Is this essential for the primary use case?

**Implementation Principle**: The optimal process requires only 6-7 well-crafted prompts using message editing and phase blocking to achieve complete architectural specification.



**Prompt 6 (Phase 5: Principled Boundary Setting and Implementation):**
```
The system name will honor "Sinatra". Break it down to consice vision, prd and implementation md files. No over engendering.
```


**Prompt 7 (Phase 5: Final Documentation):**
```
Now a final document that explains the philosophy and the choices we did.
```
