## 5. Critical Implementation Principles

### 5.1 The Message Editing Protocol

Traditional chat-based development leads to context drift and vision loss. GPA requires disciplined message editing rather than continuation prompting. This maintains focus and prevents the AI's natural tendency to satisfy only the latest request.

### 5.2 Phase Blocking Discipline

The methodology demands complete satisfaction with each phase before progression. This prevents rushing to implementation before achieving architectural clarity and ensures each phase delivers its intended value.

### 5.3 Token Economics and Butterfly Effect

Every word in human prompts carries weight in AI interpretation. Careless phrasing can derail entire architectural directions. GPA emphasizes careful, intentional communication that guides rather than confuses AI analysis.

### 5.4 The ADHD Challenge

Instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit attention patterns similar to severe ADHD - brilliant analytical capability combined with extreme distractibility. GPA's structured approach provides the consistency needed to maintain AI focus on architectural objectives.

### 5.5 Strategic Naming

Project names aren't cosmetic choices but cognitive anchors. "Sinatra" immediately evoked "My Way" philosophy, which then guided every subsequent decision. Strategic naming becomes a form of AI prompt engineering embedded in the project identity.
