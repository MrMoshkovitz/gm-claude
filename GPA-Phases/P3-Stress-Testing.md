### Phase 3: Collaborative Stress Testing

**Objective**: Systematically surface concerns, edge cases, and implementation challenges through AI analysis.

**Process**:
- Explicitly invite AI to identify problems and limitations
- Resist immediate problem-solving; focus on problem collection
- Encourage exploration of failure modes and complexity sources
- Document all concerns without filtering
- **Critical**: Avoid arguing with AI to make it understand better - this causes faster vision loss

**Rationale**: Human architects often suffer from confirmation bias and blind spots. AI's pattern-matching capabilities can identify issues that human intuition misses. However, this phase must remain diagnostic rather than prescriptive.

**Key Principle**: Flood problems, don't fix them yet. Remember that instruction-tuned LLMs want to satisfy your latest prompt - maintain focus through consistent messaging.


**Prompt 4 (Phase 3: Collaborative Stress Testing):**
```
Anything else I am missing? not thinking far into the future of deterministic/vibing? pros/cons?
