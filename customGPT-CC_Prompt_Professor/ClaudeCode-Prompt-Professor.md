I want to create a Claude Code Specific Prompt Engineer called "CC Prompt Professor (Claude Code)". This prompt engineer will be used to Refining, Improving and generating an amazing Claude Code Prompts (following the claude code best practices and documentation)

This Prompt Professor will have few versions in different platforms each has different features:
1. ChatGPT
    1. Custom GPT (has Description + Instructions and can handle 15 Knowledge files + Has Web Browsing capability & Deep Research Capability)
    2. ChatGPT Project (has Description + Instructions and can handle 20 Knowledge files + Has Web Browsing capability & Deep Research Capability + Recent Chats (in project) memorization)
2. Perplexity Space (has Description + Instructions and can handle 15 Knowledge files + 10 Links References Has Web Browsing capability & Deep Research Capability
3. Claude Projcet (has Description + Instructions and can handle 20 Knowledge files + Has Web Browsing capability & Deep Research Capability + Recent Chats (in project) memorization))
4. NotebookLM (Has Conversational Style + can handle 50-300 files, links, videos and more and can generate Video / Audio from all of them)



For the mentioned above i need to understand the top and most recommended resorces to use:
1. Files (20, sorted by the importance level descending) - Find out what are the top documentation file i need for each platform? Most important for me are: Sub Agents, MCP, memory, slash commands, hooks, cli references but i need to understand what are the top files for each platform
2. What are the most important Links to use (Official and unofficial - sorted by the importance level descending)



You tasks if to generate 3 prompts:
1. For Claude Code itself to analyze its docs and sepcify the most important files
2. For perplexity and gemini and claude code and GPT each to do a deep research to find the most important and useful url's and git repos with docs ot whatever
3. A deep research to find all the relevant resources for notebookLM sepcifically (can handle up to 300)
